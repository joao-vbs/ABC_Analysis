Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform ABC analysis using Machine Learning techniques, specifically the K-Means Clustering algorithm. ABC analysis is a method of categorizing inventory items based on their contribution to overall revenue, following the Pareto principle. The goal is to identify a small percentage of items that generate the majority of income (A-items), a moderate percentage that contributes somewhat (B-items), and a large percentage that contributes minimally (C-items).

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with the complete analysis, including data preparation, visualization, and model training.
scripts/: Python scripts for executing the ABC analysis with Machine Learning.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how to apply ABC analysis using Machine Learning, particularly K-Means Clustering, to categorize inventory items based on their contribution to overall revenue. This method helps in making informed decisions about inventory management, focusing on the most impactful items.
